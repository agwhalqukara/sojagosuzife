A name synonymous with action-packed blockbusters, Shane Black is one of Hollywood's most acclaimed screenwriters and directors. Known for pioneering the buddy-cop genre with "Lethal Weapon," Black's creative genius extends to successful films like "Iron Man 3" and "The Nice Guys." His knack for blending action, humor, and wit has made him one of the most bankable talents in the industry, with box office successes and the title of one of the highest-paid screenwriters at one point in his career.</p><h2 id=highest-paid-screenwriter><strong>Highest Paid Screenwriter</strong></h2><p>In 1987, when he was only 26-years-old, Shane Black sold his screenplay for "Lethal Weapon" to Warner Brothers for $250,000. Warner Brothers then chipped-in another $150,000 when the movie was actually produced. Made on a budget of $15 million, Lethal Weapon became a massive success when he generated $120 million at the box office (and ultimately spawned several sequels and a TV series). Shane earned $150,000 for working on "Lethal Weapon II," but the full screenplay was eventually completed by a different writer after Shane went through a creative crisis and bowed-out.</p><p>Released in 1989, "Lethal Weapon 2" went on to earn $230 million off its $30 million budget.</p><p>When Shane finally came up for air from a two-year Hollywood hiatus, he had a screenplay for a film he called "The Last Boy Scout. Every studio in Hollywood was desperate to land the rights. A bidding war ensued and Shane ultimately accepted $1.75 million from Geffen and Warner Brothers. He was 30 years old at the time. Incredibly, he actually turned down a higher offer of $2.5 million from Carolco and Ti-Star because his producing partner on Lethal Weapon, <a href=# title="Joel Silver Net Worth">Joel Silver</a>, had a deal with Geffen and Warners.</p><p>The sale briefly made Shane the highest paid screenwriter in the world. He was overtaken in 1992 when <a href=# title="Joe Eszterhas Net Worth">Joe Eszterhas</a> sold his screenplay for what became "Basic Instinct" for $3 million. Shane then re-gained the record in 1995 when he received $4 million for what became "The Long Kiss Goodnight."</p><p>At his peak, Shane commanded $1 million from a studio to spend just ONE WEEK "touching up" a script.</p><h2 id=shane-black-salaries-earnings><strong>Shane Black Salaries/Earnings</strong></h2><p>Here is a quick list of the major upfront salaries Shane received for his screenplay rights.
