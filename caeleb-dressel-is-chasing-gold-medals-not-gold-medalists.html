His expertise lies in the sprint events, where he shows off his freestyle and butterfly skills.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Dressel has broken many records throughout his career. He started swimming professionally in 2012, where he was the youngest male swimmer in the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He has won various accolades and broken&nbsp;American records in many instances, like the World Championships from 2017 to 2019, and the International Swimming League in 2018 and 2019.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Dressel is also an Olympic Champion who has won two golds in the 2016 Summer Olympics. He is also taking part in the <a href=# rel=follow>Tokyo Olympics</a>&nbsp;2020, hoping to win gold for the USA&nbsp;once again.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Given how Dressel is earning many accolades, he is constantly compared with Michael Phelps. However, Dressel thinks the comparison is unnecessary.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dressel Is Becoming Better Than Yesterday&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Phelps is one of the best Olympians to date, with 28 medals in his bag. He broke the world records when he earned eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Phelps has now retired, and for the past 13 years, no one has broken his records. But people believe that if there is one person who can break them, it is Dressel.&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with GQ</a> on June 18, 2021, Dressel addressed this expectation. He understood why people were putting him against Phelps and comparing their skills, but Dressel said they were “completely irrelevant.”&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He gave an example to prove his point further. He compared Michael Jordan and LeBron James, the two best NBA players, and pointed out that both were good at what they do.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Look, I'm going to turn on the TV to watch LeBron. I don't care if he's better than Jordan. He's amazing at what he does. Why does it matter if he's better than MJ or not?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Dressel focused on what was more important to him — to beat his own records, not Phelps. He loves the sport and defined it as the “most primitive form of competition.”</p><p>Therefore, he has started his block and has been practicing. He claimed that whatever the outcome will be, it will be his fault and nobody else.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dressel’s Tiny Little Habits</h2><p>According to the swimmer, it is not just practice that makes him a winner. Instead, there are a lot of small habits he embodies&nbsp;that contribute to him winning.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Some of them include making the bed unless his wife sleeps late, sleeping eight and half hours every night, writing&nbsp;a diary, and noting down everything about his practice from his feelings to records on his swim logbook.&nbsp;</p><p>He is not invested in social media. He has deleted his Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook and only uses Instagram. But he does not spend more than 15 minutes of his day on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>While some people may classify these things as stupid, Dressel strongly believes that these habits are one reason he has had success in swimming.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Therefore, no matter what, the olympian does these “stupid, mundane little tasks.” This year, Dressel is under a lot of pressure for the Tokyo Olympics 2020. He is the co-captain of the USA swimming team with Ryan Murphy.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">been qualified</a> for the 50 and 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter butterfly. Similarly, he is expected to swim on 4x100-meter medley relays and 4x100-meter freestyle.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuRmrmmroydqZ6ro5q5br%2FWoqSmoZ6cerC42KanopujY7W1ucs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcaeleb-dressel-is-chasing-gold-medals-not-gold-medalists.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcaeleb-dressel-is-chasing-gold-medals-not-gold-medalists.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcaeleb-dressel-is-chasing-gold-medals-not-gold-medalists.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcaeleb-dressel-is-chasing-gold-medals-not-gold-medalists.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcaeleb-dressel-is-chasing-gold-medals-not-gold-medalists.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcaeleb-dressel-is-chasing-gold-medals-not-gold-medalists.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cristina-saralegui-net-worth-2024-earnings-real-estate-and-financial-success.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cristina-saralegui-net-worth-2024-earnings-real-estate-and-financial-success.html>Cristina Saralegui Net Worth 2024: Earnings, Real Estate, and Financial Success</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./billionaire-ken-griffin-wants-to-move-the-109-year-old-home-of-william-jennings-bryan-off-his-106-m.html>Billionaire Ken Griffin Wants To Move The 109-Year-Old Home Of William Jennings Bryan Off His $106 M</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./billionaire-ken-griffin-wants-to-move-the-109-year-old-home-of-william-jennings-bryan-off-his-106-m.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
