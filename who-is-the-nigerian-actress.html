She is the first daughter and second child born to her parents. Though not much is known about Linda’s family, we do know that her small family of five also includes a younger sister and an older brother.</p><p>Linda grew up with her grandmother, who took care of her until she was eight years old when she left the shores of Nigeria for Canada. There, she had her basic and secondary education before studying Psychology at York University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2013. Upon completing her University education, Linda relocated to Lagos, Nigeria, to pursue her acting career.</p><h2><strong>Linda Joined Nollywood at the Age of 24</strong></h2><p>Linda Osifo officially joined the Nigerian film industry in 2013, but her career as an actress didn’t begin with Nollywood. In fact, she began acting in 2012 when she starred in Family Secrets directed by famous filmmaker Ikechukwu Onyeka in New Jersey, USA. A year before that, she contested and was first runner-up in Miss Nigeria Entertainment Canada 2011 and 2nd runner-up in Miss AfriCanada 2011 beauty pageant.</p><p>Having participated in a beauty pageant, hosted an awards show, and hosted a TV show in Toronto, Canada, Linda was hopeful that a return to her home country would help her reach her dreams of making it big in her career. She eventually took the bold step in late 2013 and got her first major acting gig in 2014, starring in the Nollywood film King Akubueze, directed by Nonso Emekewe. This, of course, was after being rejected on numerous occasions by producers due to her accent.</p><p>Making it in Nollywood was not quite easy for the ex-beauty queen, who revealed how tedious it was for her at the beginning. However, with her determination as well as her open-mindedness, she was able to scale through. She had her breakthrough in Ebonylife Studios’ Desperate Housewives Africa. The 2015 comedy-drama-mystery TV series is a Pan-African version of the American television series, <i>Desperate Housewives.</i></p><p>Her role as “Rhetta Moore” in the series earned her her very first award recognition in the Best Actress in a Television Series category of the Exquisite Ladies of the Year Award. It also ushered her the golden opportunity to meet with other fast-rising actors in the industry like &nbsp;Kehinde Bankole, Nini Wacera, Joseph Benjamin, Omotu Bissong, Michelle Dede, and Marcy Dolapo Oni</p><h2><strong>Linda Osifo’s Best Movies</strong></h2><p>Now listed among the top fast-rising actresses in the industry, Linda has continued to make a name for herself by appearing in several mind-blowing films and aligning herself with well-celebrated stars in the industry.
