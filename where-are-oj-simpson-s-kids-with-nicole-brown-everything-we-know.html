When he left as an NFL player, he pursued a career in acting and broadcasting. The former American collegiate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met his first wife</a>, Marguerite L. Whitley, at San Francisco State University. They married between 1967 and 1979.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/62ea5fc2162ecb8b.jpg><h2>Who is Nicole Brown?</h2><p class=align-left>Nicole is OJ's ex-wife. She worked as a waitress at a Beverly Hills private club, Daisy, when she started dating the professional gridiron football player. When Simpson and Marguerite divorced in March 1979, he married Brown on 2 February 1985.</p><p class=align-left>Nicole and OJ's marriage was marred with alleged abuse. She called the police on several occasions to report Simpson. In 1989, after he was arrested and pleaded no contest to spousal abuse, his wife dropped the charges after encouragement from her parents.</p><h2>What happened to Nicole Brown?</h2><p class=align-left>Brown was <a id=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nicole-brown-simpson-and-ron-goldman-murdered href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stabbed to death</a> on 12 June 1994, outside her home, along with 25-year-old restaurant waiter Ron Goldman. Simpson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was arrested</a> after his DNA was found at the scene. Items, including hair and fibres from Brown and her friend Goldman, were found in OJ's car and at his home. After being arrested and charged in 1994, in October 1995, he was acquitted.</p><h2>Was OJ at Nicole's funeral?</h2><p class=align-left>OJ's kids and himself<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> were present</a> at the event. He reportedly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">escorted his children</a> to the funeral. During the service, Simpson reportedly murmured something that sounded like an apology.</p><h3>Who are OJ Simpson's kids?</h3><p class=align-left>While their union lasted, OJ Simpson's children with Marguerite were three. They are Arnelle, Jason, and Aaren. Nicole Brown and Simpson's kids were two in total. Nicole gave birth to Sydney and Justin.</p><h2>What happened to OJ Simpson's kids?</h2><p class=align-left>OJ and Nicole's kids have maintained a low profile since their mother died and continue living out of the public eye. Justin and Sydney were five and eight years old, respectively, when the murder happened in 1994.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a07c5f7c61e4e3eb.jpg><h2>Who raised OJ Simpson's kids?</h2><p class=align-left>Nicole Simpson's kids moved to Florida with their father, OJ. But Nicole's family kept in touch with them. According to their aunt Tanya Brown, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she said</a>:</p>After the trials were done, my mom and I were like Team Brown. We had a meeting point where we transported the kids and picked the kids up and dropped the kids off. We were in constant contact with him because of the kids.<h2>OJ Simpson's kids today</h2><p class=align-left>The children have gone to college and are reportedly in relationships. Sydney <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lives with Robert Blackmon</a>, her boyfriend. Robert is active in local <a href=#>politics</a> near their St. Petersburg, Florida home and even ran for City Council for the seaside city.</p><p class=align-left>Sydney runs Simpsy Properties LLC, a <a href=#>real estate company</a>, where she secures housing for renters as a property manager. Justin, Sydney's brother, also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">works at Coldwell Banker</a>, a real estate company in St. Petersburg.</p><p class=align-left>OJ Simpson's kids with Nicole Brown were young when they lost their mother. But they have been able to wade off the pain and make their lives meaningful. Though they live a private life away from the media, they continue to strive to be the best they can be in their various endeavours.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Who are Frankie Avalon's children with Kathryn Diebel?
