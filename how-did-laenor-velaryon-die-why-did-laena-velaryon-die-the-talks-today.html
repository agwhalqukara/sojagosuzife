<time>19 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2 id=house_of_the_dragon class=smooth-goto>House Of The Dragon</h2><p>Episode 6 of House of the Dragon added to the drama while revealing the relationship between Daemon Targaryen and Laena Velaryon, who married during the ten-year time jump from episode 5. The episode allowed us to see the dynamics between the characters, as Daemon felt he didn’t belong anywhere, and Laena tried to tell him how great a man he had always been. Nonetheless, near the end, Laena committed suicide after struggling with childbirth. So, Why Did Laena Velaryon Die?</p><p>Image source: Twitter</p><h2 id=how_did_laenor_velaryon_die class=smooth-goto>How Did Laenor Velaryon Die?</h2><p>According to all accounts, Laenor Velaryon was stabbed to death by his lover, Ser Qarl Correy, while he was attending a fair in Spicetown on Driftmark. The two men had been arguing loudly in public before. Grand Maester Mellos simply states that Laenor was killed in a fight with a household knight, whereas Septon Eustace claims it was a lover’s feud because Laenor had slighted Correy in favour of a new attractive young man who had caught his eye.&nbsp;</p><p>Daemon Targaryen had bribed Qarl Correy to murder Laenor, after which Correy fled to a ship Daemon had waiting for him, where Daemon slit his throat and dumped his corpse into the sea. Correy was known for extravagant spending, with lord’s tastes but a knight’s purse, and was also prone to gambling, so bribery was a possibility. Nonetheless, no proof of Daemon’s involvement was ever discovered.</p><p><span class=picture_container><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1664180550_630_How-Did-Laenor-Velaryon-Die-Why-Did-Laena-Velaryon-Die.webp.webp></span></p><p>Image Source: Twitter</p><h2 id=why_did_laena_velaryon_die class=smooth-goto>Why Did Laena Velaryon Die?</h2><p>How Laena died appears to be in contrast to how Queen Aemma died, as she had a say in how she died, whereas the former queen had no voice in how she died. While Laena was left alone in the world with her daughters and husband, she was able to die on her terms rather than allowing another person to dictate it. Laena Velaryon committed suicide because she desired to die as a dragon rider. She struggled with her labours at the time, and the only way for her child to come out was through the knife. In that regard, she was going to die either way and chose to die on her terms.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=picture_container><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1664180551_482_How-Did-Laenor-Velaryon-Die-Why-Did-Laena-Velaryon-Die.webp.webp></span></p><p>Image source: Twitter</p><h2 id=how_did_laena_velaryon_die class=smooth-goto>How Did Laena Velaryon Die?</h2><p>Laena was struggling to give birth to her third child with Daemon. She was doing everything she could to force the child out of her womb, as were the masters present. Nonetheless, they had no choice but to cut the child out of her womb with a knife. Even so, the maester told Daemon that Laena would die and that there was no guarantee the child would survive. Laena was struggling to give birth to her third child with Daemon.

Even so, the maester told Daemon that Laena would die and that there was no guarantee the child would survive.</p><p>Laena’s fate was already decided at that point in her life. She couldn’t give birth naturally meant that both she and her child would perish. And if Daemon chose to remove the child from her womb, she would die from blood loss because there was no guarantee that the child would survive.</p><p>Laena, ever the proud dragon rider, chose to go out on her terms. She once told Daemon that she wished to die as a dragon rider and was content with her life and herself at the time. However, Laena realised she wasn’t Daemon’s first choice, nor wasn’t even Viserys’s first choice.</p><p>Laena died by commanding her dragon to burn her alive, an appropriate end for a dragon rider. She may have abandoned her two daughters, but they knew she would die anyway.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=who_dies_in_episode_6_of_house_of_dragon class=smooth-goto>Who Dies In Episode 6 of House of Dragon?</h2><p>Being a Game of Thrones series, there is always the possibility of significant deaths around every corner. This week’s House of the Dragon episode is no exception, especially with all the changes brought about by the time jump. As is the case most weeks, Rhaenyra and Alicent are safe. For the first time in a long time, Viserys appears to be safe, even though the previous episode ended with a cliffhanger implying his death. However, based solely on when the episode takes place in the Fire & Blood timeline, Laenor and Laena Velaryon are most likely in danger this week. Laenor Velaryon died about a decade after marrying Rhaenyra, and Laena died the same year as her brother. The 10-year time jump suggests that those events could occur soon. That being said, The show has already demonstrated that it will make changes to the source material, so the timing of those deaths may change, or the characters’ fates may be altered entirely.</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
