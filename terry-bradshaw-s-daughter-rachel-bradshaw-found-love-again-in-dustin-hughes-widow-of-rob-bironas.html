Unfortunately, she lost her spouse the same year that they were married. Back in 2014, she posted on her Facebook,</p><p>"Two years ago, today, I met the most amazing man in the world. I married him and lost him shortly after."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/85ee5486a5a687e3b27229b918df7815%20(1)-1580206447706.jpg><p>Rachel added and told audiences to tell your loved ones, how much you love them every single day and don't hold grudges.</p><h2>What Happened To Rachel Bradshaw's Husband, Rob Bironas?</h2><p>Rob was found dead tragically after three months of their marriage, which was on <i>20 September 2014</i>, at around <i>11</i> pm. The cause of his death was blunt force trauma caused by the car crash. At that time, his blood-alcohol level was <i>0.218%</i>, and he lost control of his <i>2009 </i>Yukon Denali and crashed.</p><p>Before the incident happened, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bironas left the house at 10:30 pm</a>, saying her Goodnight, and she assumed that he was going to bed. However, she didn't find him on the couch and started searching and calling relatives. It was unusual behavior of him to leave like that, and she called the police.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/ByCus2EIAAAhPvl.jpg%20large%20(1)-1580206601241.jpg><p>She added, there were no fights and arguments between them, and he was not intoxicated when he was at home. After 15 minutes of his disappearance, a student at Belmont University called, saying that he threatened to kill him and his passengers.</p><p>Following the call from the student, a woman called <i>911 </i>and said Bironas tried to start a fight with her and her husband. Shortly after the call, he was found dead in the car crash.</p><h2>Wedding Ring As A Necklace</h2><p>Being a widow in a short period is very tragic and heartbreaking. Rachel has gone through the same unfortunate incident when she lost her partner, Rob Bironas, after marrying him for three months. On his memory and love, she got a tattoo on her wrist saying "Warrior" in November and announced on Facebook,</p><p>"That's what Rob stood for. He was a warrior and forever will be."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/download-1580206504386.jpg><p>Not only that, but she has also made her wedding ring a unique symbol of love by turning it into a necklace and wearing it. She uploaded a picture of it on her Facebook back on <i>3 December 2014</i>.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>As a country singer, she might be earning a decent amount of money until now. The average income of a country singer is around <strong>$35,000</strong> as of<i> 2020</i>. So, she might be making about <strong>$40,000</strong> per year from her profession. Apart from her earnings and fortune, her late husband, Rob Bironas' net worth was about <strong>$12 Million</strong> at the time of his death.</p><p>As the couple does not share any children, she must have inherited all of his earnings and money. So, her net worth is around <strong>$12 Million</strong> as of now. Further, her father, Terry's<strong> </strong>luck, is approximately <strong>$20 Million</strong> as of now.</p><p><i><strong>Stay Updated With Us: </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jquYnKCVoXqjvsCdqqGZpw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fterry-bradshaw-s-daughter-rachel-bradshaw-found-love-again-in-dustin-hughes-widow-of-rob-bironas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fterry-bradshaw-s-daughter-rachel-bradshaw-found-love-again-in-dustin-hughes-widow-of-rob-bironas.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fterry-bradshaw-s-daughter-rachel-bradshaw-found-love-again-in-dustin-hughes-widow-of-rob-bironas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fterry-bradshaw-s-daughter-rachel-bradshaw-found-love-again-in-dustin-hughes-widow-of-rob-bironas.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fterry-bradshaw-s-daughter-rachel-bradshaw-found-love-again-in-dustin-hughes-widow-of-rob-bironas.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fterry-bradshaw-s-daughter-rachel-bradshaw-found-love-again-in-dustin-hughes-widow-of-rob-bironas.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-to-lmfao.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-to-lmfao.html>What happened to LMFAO?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./penny-hardaway-net-worth-2024.html>Penny Hardaway Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./penny-hardaway-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
