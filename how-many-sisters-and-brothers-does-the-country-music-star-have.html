In 1974, she caught the attention of a record producer while singing the national anthem at a rodeo championship. Since that time, the Country Music Hall of Fame artist has sold 56 million albums and is not only one of the world’s most successful recording artists, but also a well-regarded actor and producer. “The Greatest Man I Never Knew” performer has hosted the CMA awards show, won <a href=#>best female vocalist</a> several times, won three Grammy Awards, and received the Kennedy Center Honors lifetime contribution award. The <a href=#>66-year-old performer</a> grew up on an Oklahoma cattle ranch surrounded by a loving family that she remains close with today.

Her mother, also a singer, was a <a href=#>powerful influence</a> in getting her career started. As far as siblings are concerned, Reba McEntire has two sisters and one brother. Together they would tour the country with their parents, <a href=#>performing at rodeos</a> throughout the Midwest as the Singing McEntires.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_63>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wide Open Country</a>, McEntire’s older brother Pake signed to RCA Nashville in 1986. His biggest hit, “Savin’ My Love for You,” peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard chart. Pake put out a few more albums, with minor success, until finally deciding to hang up his microphone. He now runs a 1,000-acre cattle ranch in Oklahoma, continuing his family’s passion for rodeo.</p><p id=par-4_35>Alice Foran is McEntire’s older sister and the only sibling that did not pursue a singing career. A retired social worker living in Oklahoma, she has stayed out of the spotlight throughout her sister’s fame.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_50>“The Heart Won’t Lie” singer also has a younger sister, Susie McEntire-Eaton. In the early ’80s, the two women toured together, and Susie was featured on two of McEntire’s albums.
